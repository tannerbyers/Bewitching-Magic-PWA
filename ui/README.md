# Bewitching Magic UI

This project was created to provide my wife with rituals based on the moon phase.

## Few things to note

- This is a PWA written in React and Tailwind (because I like all of these)
- I don't like images so I mostly use emojis
- I like tests and good dev workflows so I'm going to extra spend time on these.
- Will be focused primarily on mobile. My wife doesn't use desktops so I'm not going to build around it.
- Will be readable but not easily customizable. I'm not making a template so I'm going to focus on minimal code.

### To do

- [x] Create base application as PWA
- [x] Add test to make sure application works and home page shows
- [x] Add Figma design to main repo
- [x] Add Tailwind, Fonts, Images
- [x] Add all images needed (favicon)
- [ ] Build out all components for general hierarchy
- [ ] Connect UI to API
- [ ] Create Hero Section
- [ ] Create Rituals Section
- [ ] Create Items Section
