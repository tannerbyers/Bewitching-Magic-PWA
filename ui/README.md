# Bewitching Magic UI

This project was created to provide my wife with rituals based on the moon phase.

## Few things to note

- This is a PWA written in React and Tailwind (because I like all of these)
- I don't like images so I mostly use emojis
- I like tests and good dev workflows so I'm going to extra spend time on these.
- Will be focused primarily on mobile. My wife doesn't use desktops so I'm not going to build around it.
- Will be readable but not easily customizable. I'm not making a template so I'm going to focus on minimal code.
